description: Open MARVIN in your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
---

# /code - Open in IDE

Open the MARVIN directory in your preferred IDE.

## Instructions

### 1. Determine IDE
Try these in order until one works:
1. `cursor .` - Cursor (preferred if available)
2. `code .` - VS Code

### 2. Open
Run the command to open the current directory in the IDE.

### 3. Confirm
Let the user know which IDE was opened. If neither command works, suggest they install Cursor or VS Code, or let you know what IDE they use so you can try that command instead.
